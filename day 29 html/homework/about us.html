<h2>A Legacy of Quality Fruit Growing and Gifting</h2> <br>
<p>Central to our success in growing incredible fruit and building <br>
elegant gifts around them is the uniquely beautiful and fertile area <br>
in which we live. Nestled at the base of the majestic Mount Hood lies <br>
a microclimate that produces 46 inches of annual rainfall, most of which <br>
is deposited in the winter and spring, enriching the soil before the trees <br>
blossom. Warm, dry summers and autumns allow our fruit to ripen to maturity <br>
in the warm sun. The Hood River Valley (pictured) lies positioned between the <br>
two Stratovolcanoes, Mount Hood (11,249 feet) and Mount Adams (12,276 feet), <br>
as well as the mighty Columbia River to the north. Our orchards are highly <br>
enriched by the volcanic soil of this fertile valley, while mountain glaciers <br>
feed the local streams and orchards. These factors contribute to the richness <br>
and flavor of the fruit that thrive here.  Each piece of fruit is carefully <br>
selected, picked at its peak, and nurtured to preserve its freshness.  <br>
This meticulous care extends throughout gift-building, from assembly to doorstep <br> 
delivery. The genuine joy that stems from satisfied customers, as shared through <br>
reviews and heartwarming stories, is what we live for. As we journey towards a century <br> 
of excellence, we invite you to join us in experiencing the delight of sharing The Fruit <br>
Company's exceptional creations with your family and friends.   </p>
