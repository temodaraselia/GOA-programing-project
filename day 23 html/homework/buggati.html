<h1>Bugatti Bolide </h1>

<P><b>The Bugatti Bolide is a track-only sports <br>
car developed by Bugatti Engineering GmbH in Wolfsburg, <br> 
Germany and Bugatti Automobiles and manufactured in Molsheim, <br> 
by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., <br>
revealed online on October 28, 2020. According to Bugatti, <br>
the concept version of the Bolide is using the W16 engine with <br>
a weight-to-power-ratio of 0.91 kg/kW (0.67 kg/PS; 1.50 lb/hp). <br>
Bugatti announced the Bolide would be the last car ever made with <br>
their 8.0 liter W16 engine with four turbochargers. The Bolide's <br>
name comes from the ancient Greek word βολίς, which literally means <br>
"spear" then used in old French as le bolide to describe "the meteorite <br>
blazing across the sky", in reference to its speed.  </b></P>

<h1>Specifications and performance</h1>


<P><b>The concept Bolide is built using the framework of <br>
the same 8 L (490 cu in) quad-turbo W16 engine and the <br>
7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission used in the Chiron, <br> 
although upgrades to the W16 engine allow the Bolide to generate <br>
over 1,361 kW (1,825 hp; 1,850 PS) and 2,000 N⋅m (1,475 lb⋅ft) of <br>
torque, 183 kW (245 hp; 248 PS), more than the Chiron Super Sport <br>
300+. This increase in power can be attributed to bigger blades in <br>
the turbochargers and the different orientation of the turbochargers <br>
themselves. Combining the fact that the kerb weight of the car is only <br>
1,240 kg (2,733.7 lb), the Bolide can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) <br>
in 2.2 seconds, 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 4.4 seconds, 0–300 km/h (186 mph) <br>
in 7.4  </b></P>
