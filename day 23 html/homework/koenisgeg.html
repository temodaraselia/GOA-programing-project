<h1>Top-1</h1>

<h1>Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut—330 mph </h1>

<b><p>Just as powerful as its track-focused sibling, the Jesko <br>
Absolut is the more seamless and stealthy of the two. Every <br>
surface element is constructed to reduce drag or surrounding <br>
turbulence while increasing high-speed stability. <br>

With a drag coefficient value of only 0.278 Cd, a frontal area <br>
of just 1.88 m² and a massive 1600 horsepower, the Jesko <br> 
Absolut is destined to achieve higher, more extraordinary <br>
speeds than any Koenigsegg or any other fully homologated <br>
car before it. How fast? Time will tell. Looking at the math and <br>
our advanced simulations – it will be unbelievably fast.</p></b>

<h1>Lightest V8 Crankshaft </h1>

<p><b>The Jesko Absolut is powered by a 1280 bhp <br>
(1600 bhp on E85), twin turbo charged V8 engine, <br>
featuring the world’s lightest V8 crankshaft, <br>
weighing just 12.5 kg. This flat-plane 180-degree <br>
crankshaft produces more power with greater efficiency <br>
while achieving a high 8500 rpm rev limit. Its design <br>
allows even firing across engine banks, creating a <br>
visceral engine sound. Koenigsegg has also designed <br>
super-light connecting rods and pistons to counter  <br>
the tendency of greater vibrations in flat-plane engines.</b></p>

<h1>Superior CFD</h1>

<p><b> Koenigsegg's CFD team went over every <br>
detail of the Jesko in a meticulous study in <br>
order to minimise drag.  The most obvious change <br>
made was the removal of the Jesko Attack's massive <br>
rear wing, which dropped downforce from 1400kg to <br>
150kg.  The target drag coefficient for the Jesko <br>
Absolut was 0.28Cd.  Our CFD team overachieved, <br>
with a final figure of just 0.278 Cd.  </b></p>

<h1>Pressure coefficient </h1>
<p><b>While peak pressure occurs in the <br>
Jesko Absolut's front radiator, the rest <br>
of the car has significantly reduced downforce. <br> 
Modifications applied to the Jesko Absolut include <br>
more streamlined front splitter winglets, re-designed <br>
front louvers, an elongated tail, and the addition of <br>
aerodynamic, removable wheel covers. Every surface <br>
finish is intended to be as slick as possible, to <br>
allow air to glide effortlessly over the car. </b></p>
