<h1>BMW</h1>

<p>Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG),[4] trading as BMW Group (commonly abbreviated to BMW (German pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] ⓘ), sometimes anglicised as Bavarian Motor Works), is a German multinational conglomerate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Germany. The moniker, "BMW ", first came into use when the German firm Rapp Motorenwerke changed its name to Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH (BMW GmbH) in 1917. Thereafter, in 1922, the name and assets of BMW GmbH were transferred to the aircraft manufacturer Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik), thereby giving rise to the company known today as BMW AG.[5][6]</p>
